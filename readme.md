### Phase 0 : Choosing a Dataset
12/4 Monday
- This semester I was introduced to the ideas of Ted Nelson, who believed in the "mind-bending, gut-slamming" power of computers. He pioneered the idea of "hypertext" and got me thinking about how computers and web pages can be used in interesting, interconnected ways that lead to new artistic abilities.
- The idea of representing webpages as a graph is fascinating; I would like to be able to analyze the links, cycles, and paths between different pages.
- From a preliminary search on Stanford's Database, I found a database from Google and one from Reddit.
12/6 Wednesday
- I decided to attempt to use the Reddit dataset; it has a lot richer information as well as weighted edges corresponding to the attitude toward the pages.
- Wrote data_description.txt

### Phase 1 : Reading In
12/6
- Goal: Read in data
    - Create node (if not already): Source subreddit
    - Create node (if not already): Target subreddit
    - Create edge: Data = Post_Label (-1 if negative, 1 if neutral or positive)
- Imported file and set up file reading

12/7
- Read in file
- Separated information by tabs
- Stored information in strings, printed information to start

### Phase 2 : Computation
